# ncortho
NcOrtho is a tool for the targeted search of orthologous micro RNAs (miRNAs) throughout the tree of life. Conceptually, it works similar to the program fDOG in that a probabilistic model of the target sequence in a reference species is created. For this, the orthologs of the target sequence are identified in a set of taxa that are closely related to the reference species. In contrast to fDOG, ncOrtho does not train hidden Markov Models but covariance models (CMs) (Eddy & Durbin, 1994) which also model conserved secondary structures of the miRNAs
